# python-challenge

In this challenge, we were tasked with creating a Python script for analyzing the financial records of a fictional company. Financial data was provided in CSV format and was composed of two columns: Date and Profit/Losses.  Our task was to analyze the records to calculate each of the following:

The total number of months included in the dataset.
The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

To calculate each of these, two for loops were used and respective outputs were placed into empty lists.
